# SD210_MachineLearningProject
## Description
Machine learning project where I had three different databases to clean and analyse using the different methodologies learned in the machine learning course.

## Mining hazard detection using binary classification
The first project was about detecing mining hazards using information provided seismic and seismoacoustic monitoring systems.
The dabase used was the following: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/seismic-bumpsusing

## Writing patterns using multivariate classification
The second project was about using multivariate classification to assign writing pattern seen in the avila bible to a copyist.
The database used was the following: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Avila


## Emergence of crimes using regression
The last project was about predicting the emergence of crimes from communities in the united states
The database used was the following: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/communities+and+crime
